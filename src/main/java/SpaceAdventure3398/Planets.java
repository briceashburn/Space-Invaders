 * 
 * Planets class is a class that will display larger green circles (planets) on the background class.
 * They will move downward across the screen constantly so that it simulates movement in space.
 * Once the planet reach an upper limit it will go back between a random location on y=-10000 to y=-5000
 * and be given a new size and a speed based on the size. The reason for respawning them in that range is so 
 * that they don't stay in the same location next to each other.The bigger planets move faster than the 
 * smaller ones in order to create a sense of depth and movement.
